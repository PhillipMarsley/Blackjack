# Blackjack
A simple backjack, without the ability to place bets, coded in C++ back in 2015.

Plays 8 rounds within the console and uses a lot of string manipulation.

You'll notice down below that the 'cards' apperance is broken / the parts are not in the right place. This is an error that I could not solve back then. I may update this game in the future to include colours and fix that visual glitch.
